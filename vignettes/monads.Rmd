'Monad' is a term often best avoided in conversation, and is often described in 
overly mathematical terms, the "meme" definition being the category theory verion 
which states

> "a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"

which is mostly true, but also unnecessary.

[This blog post](https://www.adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
does a great job of walking through the more practical definition, and it has 
"translations" into several programming languages including [JavaScript](https://medium.com/@tzehsiang/javascript-functor-applicative-monads-in-pictures-b567c6415221#.rdwll124i) and [Python](https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures).

Basically, `map` applies some function to some values. `flatMap` does the same, 
but first "reaches inside" a context to extract some inner values, and after 
applying the function, re-wraps the result in the original context.

The enlightening example for me is a `List` - if we have some values and want to 
apply some function to them, we can do that with, e.g.

```{r}
f <- function(x) x^2
Map(f, c(2, 4, 6))
```

and if we have a 'flat' list, this still works

```{r}
Map(f, list(2, 4, 6))
```

but what if we have an 'outer context' list?

```{r}
Map(f, list(c(2, 3), c(4, 5, 6)))
```

In this case, because `f` is vectorised, `Map` sends each vector to `f` and gets 
a result for each list. What if we have a list in the inner context?

```{r, error = TRUE}
Map(f, list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)))
```

This fails because `f(list(2, 3))` fails (it doesn't know how to deal with an 
argument which is a list).

Instead, we can use a version of 'map' that first reaches inside the outer 
`list` context, concatenates what's inside, applies the function, then re-wraps 
the result in a new, flat list

```{r}
fmap <- function(x, f) {
  list(f(unlist(x)))
}
fmap(list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)), f)
```

This is the essence of a monad - something that supports such a `fmap` 
operation that performs the mapping inside the context. There are various 
patterns which benefit from such a context, and this vignette describes an 
implementation of several of these via the {monads} package.

The `fmap` operation is so common that it's typical to find it presented as an 
infix function, similar to how pipes work in R

```{r}
list(list(2, 3), list(4, 5, 6)) |> fmap(f)
```

and we can go one step further by defining a new pipe which is just a different 
syntax for this

```
x |> fmap(f)

x %>>=% f
```

This infix function borrows from Haskell's `>>=` (pronounced "bind") which is 
so fundamental that forms part of the language's logo

```{r setup}
library(monads)
```

Additionally, some toy helper functions are defined in this package for 
demonstrating application of functions

```{r}
timestwo(4)
square(5)
add_n(3, 4)
```

## List

As per the example above, the `List` monad wraps values (which may be additional
`list`s) and when `flatMap`ed the results are 'flattened' into a single `List`.

```{r}
# identical to a regular Map
x <- listM(1, 2, 3) %>>=%
  timestwo()
x

# only possible with the flatMap approach
y <- listM(list(1, 2), list(3, 4, 5)) %>>=% 
  timestwo()
y
```

Note that while `x` and `y` print as regular lists, they remain `List` monads; 
a `print` method is defined which essentially extracts `value(x)`.

## Logger

A context could include a stored 'log' of the expressions used on each 
application. One example would be performing data transformation in a {dplyr}
pipeline (which would usually use `%>%` or more recently `|>`).

All that is required is to wrap the value at the start of the pipeline in a 
`Logger` context, which is achieved by calling the `new()` method of `Logger`

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

result <- loggerM(mtcars) %>>=%
  filter(mpg > 10) %>>=%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp) %>>=%
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>>=%
  head()
```

This result is still a `Logger` instance, not a value. To extract the value from 
this we can use `value()`. To extract the log of each step, use `logger_log()` 
(to avoid conflict with `base::log`)

```{r}
value(result)
logger_log(result)
```

This works with any data value, so we could just as easily use an in-memory 
SQLite database (or external)

```{r}
mem <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
dplyr::copy_to(mem, mtcars)

res <- loggerM(mem) %>>=%
  tbl("mtcars") %>>=%
  filter(mpg > 10) %>>=%
  select(mpg, cyl, disp) %>>=%
  arrange(desc(mpg)) %>>=%
  head()
```

Again, extracting the components from this

```{r}
value(res)
logger_log(res)
```

Since the log captures what operations were performed, we could re-run this 
expression, and a helper is available for that

```{r}
rerun(res)
```

Some similar functionality is present in the {magrittr} package which provides 
the 'classic' R pipe `%>%`; a 'functional sequence' starts with a `.` and 
similarly tracks which functions are to be applied to an arbitrary input once 
evaluated - in this way, this is similar to defining a new function.

```{r}
library(magrittr)

# define a functional sequence
fs <- . %>%
  tbl("mtcars") %>%
  select(cyl, mpg)

# evaluate the functional sequence with some input data
fs(mem)

# identify the function calls at each step of the pipeline
magrittr::functions(fs)
```

Since the functional sequence is unevaluated, errors can be present and not 
triggered

```{r, error = TRUE}
errfs <- . %>%
  sqrt() %>%
  stop("oops") %>%
  add_n(3)

x <- 1:10

errfs(x)
magrittr::functions(errfs)
```

In the monad context, steps which do raise an error nullify the value and a 
signifier is added to the log to prevent re-running the error

```{r}
resx <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  add_n(4)

value(resx)
logger_log(resx)

err <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  stop("oops") %>>=%
  add_n(3)

value(err)
logger_log(err)
```

Aside from an error destroying the value, returning a `NULL` result will also 
produce this effect

```{r}
nullify <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  ret_null() %>>=%
  add_n(7)

value(nullify)
logger_log(nullify)
```

One downside to the functional sequence approach is chaining these - since the 
first term must be `.`, that is always the first entry, and chaining multiple
sequences is not clean.

```{r}
a <- . %>% sqrt()
a

b <- . %>% a %>% add_n(1)
b

b(x)
```

Because the monad context is recreated at every step, chaining these is not a 
problem

```{r}
a <- loggerM(x) %>>=%
  sqrt()

value(a)
logger_log(a)

b <- a %>>=%
  add_n(1)

value(b)
logger_log(b)
```

## Timer

In addition to capturing the expressions in a log, the `Timer` monad also 
captures the evaluation timing for each step, storing these alongside the 
expressions themselves in a `data.frame`

```{r}
x <- timerM(5) %>>=%
  sleep_for(3) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  sleep_for(1.3)

value(x)
times(x)

y <- timerM(5) %>>=%
  sleep_for(2) %>>=%
  ret_null() %>>=%
  sleep_for(0.3)

value(y)
times(y)
```

## Maybe

In some languages it is preferrable to return _something_ rather than raising 
an error, particularly if you want to ensure that errors are handled. The 
`Maybe` pattern consists of either a `Nothing` (which is empty) or a `Just` 
containing some value; all functions applied to a `Maybe` will be one of these.

For testing the result, some helpers `is_nothing()` and `is_just()` are defined.

```{r}
x <- maybeM(9) %>>=% 
  sqrt() %>>=%
  timestwo()

value(x)
is_just(x)
is_nothing(x)

y <- maybeM(Nothing()) %>>=%
  sqrt()

value(y)
is_just(y)
is_nothing(y)

z <- maybeM(10) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  add_n(Nothing())

value(z)
is_just(z)
is_nothing(z)
```

For what is likely a much more robust implementation, see 
[{maybe}](https://armcn.github.io/maybe/).

## Result

Similar to a `Maybe`, a `Result` can contain either a successful `Ok` wrapped 
value or an `Err` wrapped message, but it will be one of these. This pattern 
resembles (and internally, uses) the `tryCatch()` approach where the evaluation 
will not fail, but requires testing what is produced to determine success, for 
which `is_ok()` and `is_err()` are defined.

```{r}
x <- resultM(9) %>>=% 
  sqrt() %>>=%
  timestwo()

value(x)
is_err(x)
is_ok(x)
```

When the evaluation fails, the error is reported, along with the value _prior_ 
to the error

```{r}
y <- resultM(9) %>>=%
  sqrt() %>>=%
  ret_err("this threw an error")

value(y)
is_err(y)
is_ok(y)

z <- resultM(10) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  add_n("banana")

value(z)
is_err(z)
is_ok(z)
```

## Extensions

The `flatMap`/"bind" operator defined here as `%>>=%` is applicable to any monad
which has a `bind()` method defined. The monads defined in this package are all
`R6Class` objects exposing such a method of the form `m$bind(.call, .quo)` which 
expects a function and a quosure. You can add your own extensions to these by 
defining such a class (and probably a constructor helper and a `print()` method)

```{r}
# a Reporter monad which reports unpiped function calls
Reporter <- R6::R6Class(
  c("ReporterMonad"),
  public = list(
    value = NULL,
    initialize = function(value) {
      if (rlang::is_quosure(value)) {
        self$value <- rlang::eval_tidy(value)
      } else {
        self$value <- value
      }
    },
    bind = function(f, expr) {
      ## 'undo' the pipe and inject the lhs as an argument
      result <- unlist(lapply(unlist(self$value), f))
      args <- as.list(c(self$value, rlang::call_args(expr)))
      fnew <- rlang::call2(rlang::call_name(expr), !!!args)
      cat(" ** Calculating:", rlang::quo_text(fnew), "=", result, "\n")
      Reporter$new(result)
    }
  )
)

reporterM <- function(value) {
  v <- rlang::enquo(value)
  Reporter$new(v)
}

print.Reporter <- function(x, ...) {
  print(value(x))
}

x <- reporterM(17) %>>=%
  timestwo() %>>=%
  square() %>>=% 
  add_n(2) %>>=%
  `/`(8)

value(x)
```

This is just a toy example; attempting to `cat()` a `data.frame` result would 
not go well.
